to &quot;On Linux Phone security&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Recently, my acquaintances sent me an article called &quot;Linux Phones&quot;. Its author, Madaidan, claims that Linux phones are a &quot;a major degradation from traditional mobile operating systems, such as Android or iOS&quot;. The author didn&#39;t seem to be much interested in objectivity: true both Linux and GNU+Linux phones do have some significant security flaws, however, the author seems to be blind or oblivious to similar or significantly bigger threat vectors associated to the other two operating systems. Rather than dismiss the author&#39;s point of view as banal shilling hidden behind a veneer of professionalism, we shall try to address their points one by one…</p><blockquote><p>Linux phones lack any significant security model and the points from the Linux article apply to Linux phones fully.</p></blockquote><p>OK. So the arguments are made in bad faith, and while we wanted to have a fair and balanced discussion on the topic of Linux security, we instead are in the unenviable position of having to meticulously pull apart Madaidan&#39;s arguments.</p><p>Unfortunately, the moment you claim gross incompetence, you invite yourself to scrutiny, and you&#39;d better be prepared to handle it. When we started this article the intention was that we would simply reflect on a few points and in the typical reasonable, measured fashion as most Linux users (I said most not all) ordinarily respond to critique of their platform of choice, uncover the truth and move on. Instead we have an open invitation to revel in verbal proctology and potentially destroy the credibility of a security researcher. I don&#39;t want to make enemies. I want to make friends. But if someone opens the conversation by spitting in your face and claiming gross incompetence… let&#39;s just say peaceful resolution is no longer an option.</p><p>And the first nitpick would be listing a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DogeCoin</a> wallet as a method of supporting oneself. If one considers themself a security researcher, nay a competent security researcher with compelling views contrary to experts in the field, one must strive to appear professional. I don&#39;t need to point out that a Cryptocurrency called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DogeCoin</a> has more red flags than an actual textile factory that ran out of all dyes except red, specialising in flag production.</p><h2 id="they-do-not-have-modern-security-features" tabindex="-1">They do not have modern security features: <a class="header-anchor" href="#they-do-not-have-modern-security-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;They do not have modern security features:&quot;">​</a></h2><p>OK. Define modern. It&#39;s tempting to say that the following list contains the aforementioned security features, but things like Verified boot are neither modern (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">&quot;Secure&quot; boot</a> was introduced in 2011, and <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/secureboot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">has more to do with locking the user out of hardware that they bought</a>, rather than preventing malware settling in. Moreover, it fails to mention that in most cases such features are security theatre, and Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/microsoft-secure-boot-firmware-snafu-leaks-golden-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">has an exceedingly bad track record</a> in implementing such features.</p><p>Application sandboxing is also highly dubious: most web browsers and virtual machines are hardly modern (<a href="https://v8.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">V8</a> released in 2008, VirtualBox released in 2007, SpiderMonkey is claimed to have been worked on in 1996, and if you ask me, the earliest proper example would be the JVM, that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2015/05/20/javas-20-years-of-innovation/?sh=1aaeebc11d7c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">appeared in 1995</a>), hardly absent from Linux (you have access to all of the above + containerisation), and most definitely qualify as strong sandboxes, in a sense in which any useful program <em>can</em> qualify as a strong sandbox.</p><h3 id="mac-policies" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MAC policies</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#mac-policies" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[MAC policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control)&quot;">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AppArmor</a>. This omision is telling.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SELinux</a> is another glaring omission (not from the article, but from the discussion of Mandatory access control policies), since it is good enough for the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/solutions/public-sector/dod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">U.S. Department of Defense</a>. At this point it is safe to say that this article is not well-researched. In fact, considering that the author is fully capable of identifying the relative popularity of bubblewrap, it is far more likely that the omission of AppArmor and SELinux is intentional.</p><p>SELinux is currently both the most widespread and most effective means of mandatory access control on Linux. Madaidan concedes to some of SELinux&#39;s virtues in an unrelated part of the article,</p><blockquote><p>SELinux does provide the <code>execmem</code> boolean, this is rarely ever used.</p></blockquote><p>though in a typical fashion, taking statistics out of their own thinking apparatus, with said apparatus firmly lodged in a comfy chair, at the very bottom of their being.</p><p>I will point out, that of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MAC policies</a> are not too well implemented. I can off the top of my head remember what I need to do on Mac, to restrict access to Accessibility features (i.e. keylogging), but I don&#39;t know what the appropriate policy is on SELinux. It should be said, though, that by the very nature of Wayland, it being the default on Gnome, and Gnome being the default for many distributions, I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s any need to disable accessibility features for one particular application.</p><p>What is more worrysome is that the MAC implementations in both Mac OS and Windows are sub-par. Windows is laughably inept, in that it thinks that UAC prompts (which most people disable, BTW), are sufficient to ward off malware. The problem at hand is lack of granularity: you want a program to install Adobe Acrobat on your system, and you trust (or rather believe), that if you uncheck the box that says &quot;install McAfee antivirus&quot;, that it will do the honourable thing and not install it. So when the prompt comes up, you say &quot;yes&quot;, and now you have the Ask toolbar, and god knows how many trojans.</p><p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lWIBN.png" alt=""></p><p>Mac OS is slightly better in that regard. It does have things approaching a pacakge manager: the trouble with the App Store is that most applications are not distributed through it. Simply put there are large incentives not to, in the size of the 30% … ahem… 27% cut that Apple takes. The user does, however gain access to automatic updates, and genuine ease, because someone at Apple really did look at the source code. The problem with MAC, is that applications that shouldn&#39;t, often ask for bizzarre permissions: for example Karabiner elements asks for accessibility permissions. What it actually asked for, was access to the Accessibility API, which is the only way of getting some kinds of information on Mac. You should be judicious about what kinds of access you are providing to your apps, and Apple App store products often don&#39;t make that easy. I&#39;m conditioned to provide Accessibility access when prompted, even though I 100% know that it&#39;s used for keylogging.</p><p>Apple does do it better, not in terms of security but in terms of usability: SELinux is a pain to set up, configure and use. I don&#39;t, off the top of my head, remember where to go in the settings on Fedora in order to tune SELinux policies. On Apple while I&#39;m much more limited in what I can do, I know precisely where to go for it, and how to revoke accessibility access to any programs I suspect of spying.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/m8nIRgy.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="verified-boot" tabindex="-1">Verified boot <a class="header-anchor" href="#verified-boot" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Verified boot&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This is BS.</p><p>First of all this is factually false, since the author neglected to mention that both the cheap PinePhone and the expensive Librem 5, both ship with U-boot, they do however omit the vendor lock, which is the sole purpose of the solution&#39;s existence.</p><p>Secondly, even if that statement were slightly better researched, verified boot is an ineffective security measure that&#39;s meant to lock a user out of their personal electronics, more than provide peace of mind.</p><p>Verified boot is a solution looking for a problem. The typical spiel, that you&#39;re given goes as follows: secure boot protects your machine from running unauthorised kernels/UEFI binaries. This is factually correct, but a loaded expression: authorised usually means &quot;having a proper signature&quot;. That is not synonymous with &quot;came from a trusted software vendor&quot; as was demonstrated by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/microsoft-secure-boot-firmware-snafu-leaks-golden-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft</a>.</p><p>The key problem is that blessed UEFI binaries can be signed on the device itself. Now consider who might want to install a malicious kernel/boot loader? You need to either have full access to the system remotely, including root access in order to modify the bootloader (since most unix-like systems don&#39;t let you change boot options willy-nilly), or you need physical access to the device.</p><p>The first case is obviously not tenable; if an attacker has remote root access to your device, it&#39;s not much of a consolation that they can&#39;t get a malicious kernel to boot. You can set up an Orwellian nightmare in userspace any day of the week, with root access to your device no less. The only salvation in such a case is (counter-intuitively) to flash the device with a fresh operating system. Now you could say &quot;AHA! But because there&#39;s no secure boot they could have installed a rootkit, and now you can&#39;t be sure that the device is clean?&quot; To that I would say, &quot;good luck flashing the contaminated (in this case both by secure boot and the rootkit) system in the first place&quot;. Not to mention that since you <strong>can</strong> update the kernel, the likelihood that you&#39;d need to flash your system falls drastically too: if the number of kernel binaries is limited, the attacker knows precisely what to attack, and exploits are inevitable. It&#39;s a lot harder to exploit <code>sudo</code> on a platform that doesn&#39;t guarantee that <code>sudo</code> exists, and isn&#39;t an alias to <code>doas</code>. More on that later.</p><p>Now suppose that you are in the even less enviable position of the attacker having access to your device physically. You&#39;re fucked. No encryption is soldering iron-proof. If they&#39;re after your data — either security measures other than secure boot will deter them, or Secure boot will slightly increase the time it takes for them to get to your data.</p><p>Does having secure boot add to your device&#39;s security? Perhaps. I just don&#39;t think that &quot;maybe deter someone who has already gained quite a lot of ground on my system&quot; is not a good trade-off for &quot;definitely make my choices fewer and further between.&quot;</p><h3 id="physical-access-means-all-bets-are-off" tabindex="-1">Physical access means all bets are off <a class="header-anchor" href="#physical-access-means-all-bets-are-off" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Physical access means all bets are off&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are companies like Cellebrite who manufacture hardware and software complexes, giving their owner an ability to access mobile hardware. There&#39;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3zpROoPOwQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Youtube video advertising their solution</a>.</p><p>Yes, the intention is to help police investigations… for now… however Such devices could be lost, stolen, if an average Detective Wiggum, can have access to it, it means that using the hardware is easy and very little verification has to be done… In other words there&#39;s nothing stopping an enterprising youth from buying such a device off a cop and using it for the same purposes as they would a rootkit. Do you honestly think that Secure boot is going to protect against this sort of attack? To be clear, if you&#39;re worried about rootkits, you should be worried about a software analogue of this solution. And Secure boot demonstrably doesn&#39;t do jack shit against this hardware.</p><p>While Apple claims to care about privacy, it is nowhere to be seen when such means are on the table. I mean, sure, they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/22/tim-cook-apple-refusal-unlock-iphone-fbi-civil-liberties" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">refused to hack a terrorist&#39;s phone</a>… but then again, it was possible to hack without their help.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjr2bPAyPV7t35MvcgT3W8Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Hated One</a> did a detailed video on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOPWNJxdxWY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">whole zero-day exploid market</a>.</p><p>You&#39;d be surprised to hear that something like TailsOS would actually help in this regard. If you don&#39;t keep a lot of this information locally, data recovery is going to be much harder.</p><h3 id="strong-app-sandboxing" tabindex="-1">Strong app sandboxing <a class="header-anchor" href="#strong-app-sandboxing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Strong app sandboxing&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yeah. Linux doesn&#39;t have it. Fedora Silverblue is a figment of out collective imagination and it cannot possibly be installable. Tails OS? Yeah, that&#39;s probably a Mac OS spin off and Qubes is based off of Microsoft Windows 9, the unreleased gem.</p><p>Jokes aside, I think Linux does need the means to sandbox some untrusted applications, which it does have, sadly. Fortunately we have AppArmor, SELinux, Firejail and Bubblewrap, all of which can cover MAC, as well as provide a form of sandboxing. We do not need it in the vast majority of cases, however, because most applications have publicly auditable source code, and most distributions have a transparent method of package compilation and delivery. There&#39;s no need to sandbox KDE applications, because they will not maliciously attack your system. And if you think that nobody audits the packages, I encourage you to try and publish malware on Debian, just as an illustration.</p><p>However, the author oftentimes makes a passing mumbling reference to Mac OS X being better, without actually providing any proof. So let&#39;s talk about that for a moment. There&#39;s a fundamental difference between an executable and an app bundle. Most programs on OS X and IOS are bundled with their dynamic libraries [1], but some applications can be distributed as bare executables. These executables are in no way limited beyond what they could access on Linux. So suppose you have an app that you don&#39;t trust. How the hell do you know that it isn&#39;t calling another bare executable and bypassing all of that sandboxing?</p><p>On Windows, it&#39;s a little more clear cut: UWP apps are indeed sandboxed. It would matter, if they were anything but a superminority of apps available on Windows. The vast majority are <code>.exe</code> kinds of executables and they can do a whole lot to your data. Sure, they need to ask for administrator privileges first, to have access to anything other than your documents folder, but that&#39;s true of Linux as well, and to a far greater extent of Mac OS X too.</p><p>[1] which in Linux is called dependency pinning. This practice is not itself problematic, but it requires the author of the package to responsibly update the versions of all of their dependencies alongside the main executable. Debian Greybeards will already be furious, because updating the dynamic library is far easier than updating the entire bundle, and happens far more frequently than either the user or one of the App Stores actually updating the bundle.</p><h3 id="modern-exploit-mitigations-old-kernels" tabindex="-1">Modern exploit mitigations [OLD KERNELS] <a class="header-anchor" href="#modern-exploit-mitigations-old-kernels" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Modern exploit mitigations [OLD KERNELS]&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The only real competition here is Apple. Android by definition is not a contender, because of the fact that most phones lose software support after 18 months at most. And before you counter with &quot;but &quot;&quot;security&quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;updates&quot;&quot;&quot;, consider that a large number of perfectly functional Android 4 devices with no upgrade path are becoming obsolete. Nominally they do still receive updates, but in reality even if the company that originally released those devices has not gone under, support for such old versions is tenuous, if at all present.</p><p>I can only speak from experience, but Apple doesn&#39;t push updated kernels all that frequently. You can expect at most one security update at least every two months. Meanwhile on Arch (i.e. Manjaro), you can expect a kernel update every week, sooner if you&#39;re compulsively doing <code>pacman -Syu</code> every time you get the chance.</p><p>This argument is moot, primarily because Linux is already the largest publicly developed software project, with the largest amount of buzz around it, with millions of lines of contributions each day. No matter how large Apple might be, or consider themselves to be, they cannot hope to match the same level of exposure. This exposure comes with what&#39;s know as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus&#39;s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Linus&#39;s law</a>: given enough eyes on the code, every bug is obvious. Apple alone, hope to match, far less exceed the expediency with which security flaws are discovered and fixed, and only so because of the large userbase, and unfettered access to gigabytes of internal telemetry, and being the only de-factor software developers on the platform. Contrast that with Android, where if Samsung discovers a security flaw, they can only quickly patch said flaw on Samsung devices, and only after some backporting, can the same fix be applied to a OnePlus.</p><p>The fact that Apple are really the only competitors in terms of security will be a running theme in our article.</p><blockquote><p>Most programs on Linux are written in memory unsafe languages, such as C or C++, which causes the majority of discovered security vulnerabilities. Other operating systems have made more progress on adopting memory safe languages, such as Windows which is leaning heavily towards Rust, a memory safe language or macOS which is adopting Swift.</p></blockquote><p>I&#39;d hate to break it to you, but if any stupid line should get you fired it&#39;s this one.</p><p>To start with, <strong>ALL OPERATING SYSTEM KERNELS</strong> which want to be competitive with Mach, minix, Linux and NT are written in programming languages with manual memory management. This is a necessity. Anything as complex as a live garbage collector is too large for kernel bootup and an extreme security risk. This still allows Nim and Swift as potential candidates, and heavily favours Rust, while the historical favourites are still C/C++ and assembly. Why? Primarily, because the people who know how to design an operating system kernel have spent most of their time practicing one kick a thousand times, rather than complaining about programming languages.</p><p>Secondly, you can write FORTRAN in any language. What this ancient saying is meant to express is that most programming languages only provide a harness that stops you from writing harmful code. It is perfectly possible to leak memory in Rust, and invoke undefined behaviour in Swift. The kinds of low-level performance optimisations that are necessary for a smooth-operating kernel are likely to require you to disable many of the safety features. You could say that in-general Haskell is both memory safe and extremely good at tracking side-effects. The assumption being that the vast majority of the program doesn&#39;t reside in the <code>IO</code> monad, invoking <code>malloc</code> via Foreign function interface, and leaking all the memory ever allocated, by arguing that &quot;Haskell has a garbage collector&quot;, thus calling <code>free</code> via FFI is not necessary. I&#39;m a Rust developer by trade, and believe me, there are precious few who appreciate the challenges associated with <code>unsafe</code>. Of all the known systems programming languages, only a small subset of rust can be considered memory safe. The best known operating system kernel written in Rust is RedoxOSs kernel, and neither Mac OS, nor Windows nor Linux intend on adopting <code>rust</code> as more than an <em>acceptable</em> language for <em>some</em> modules (stay tuned for my critique of rustlang). I sincererly doubt that with the crust that&#39;s ever present in Windows, Rust would account for more than 1% of the total code-base.</p><p>On Mac OS, it&#39;s slightly different. Can swift replace C/Objective C or C++ in the long run? Possible, but extremely unlikely. Reference counting alone is not a sufficient memory management strategy, especially in cases where process isolation among many other operating system features are not available. Nim and Rust can get away with reference counting most of the time, primarily because they enforce strong guarantees otherwise. Swift&#39;s reference counting errs on the side of caution, and expressiveness, sacrificing performance. In plain words, it means that Swift shall be avoided in the performance-critical regions of the OS kernel, and some aspects of it would still be written in (Objective) C.</p><blockquote><p>While Windows and macOS are still <strong>mostly</strong>…</p></blockquote><p>First of all, we&#39;d have to take the author&#39;s word for it. Even if they saw <em>a source code</em> for something that looks like the NT kernel, there&#39;s no guarantee that it is <em>the</em> source code for the kernel. Secondly, I would estimate that Windows has a generous 1% of its kernel logic re-written in Rust, if any of it is functional at all. Linux is not far ahead in that regard, but using a memory-safe language doesn&#39;t guarantee memory safety.</p><blockquote><p>written in memory unsafe languages, they are at least making some progress on switching to safe alternatives.</p></blockquote><p>Which is also true of Linux. Specifically, <code>rust</code> is admitted by Linus Torvalds to be a vast improvement over C++ and suitable for driver development. It is questionable whether unsafe rust is better than unsafe C, especially considering that there are no rust programmers with 30+ years of rust development experience as there are C programmers with 30+ years of C development experience.</p><p>And again, this comparison is completely unfounded. Can you point me to a source where I can see a core NT kernel function being reimplemented in <code>rust</code>? Or can you point me to a source quoting that Apple are planning on using Swift for their kernel? It would also be hamstrung by the fact that as far as we know, the kernel used by apple is a heavily modified Unix kernel, based off of BSD, which is written in… drum roll… memory-unsafe C.</p><h2 id="kill-switches" tabindex="-1">Kill switches <a class="header-anchor" href="#kill-switches" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Kill switches&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>The microphone kill switch is useless since audio can still be gotten via the sensors (such as the gyroscope or accelerometer)</p></blockquote><p>Or you could have another microphone that&#39;s not connected to the kill switch and isn&#39;t exposed to the OS. I&#39;m surprised that a seasoned security &quot;expert&quot; jumps to the least practical exploit.</p><blockquote><p>Librem 5 does have a &quot;lockdown mode&quot; that disables the sensors, it also requires flipping all of the other switches, including the network switches which effectively turns your device into a brick just to prevent audio recording.</p></blockquote><p>Wasn&#39;t the author&#39;s point earlier, that other sensors could be used to get audio? So why are you now complaining that it also (just to be safe I must add) disables the network connection? And my device would still be able to play games, perform non-network-related activity, though probably without a gyroscrope.</p><blockquote><p>To prevent cell tower triangulation, you can simply enable airplane mode and it is just as effective.</p></blockquote><p>Provided you know precisely what an Airplane mode does. Let me clarify. I haven&#39;t seen the code for Airplane mode in the source code for my Android 9 device. Probably because it&#39;s a Samsung device and the source code for the OS can not be found anywhere. With IOS, it can spontaneously decide that Airplane mode is not needed anymore and turn it back off based on criteria that I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s one of those &quot;convenience features&quot; that end up biting you in the long run.</p><p>Also, I guess that being a security researcher, you have option of signing an NDA and viewing the source code for both IOS and Android. How the hell am I supposed to know that</p><ol><li>what you&#39;re saying is voiced because it&#39;s true, not because it&#39;s what you have to say as per some terms (of e.g. the aforementioned NDA).</li><li>what you&#39;re saying is based off of the actual source code for the OS components, and not a revised version designed specifically for security researchers.</li><li>that you are qualified to say whether or not a given source code fits the criteria of being useful for cell-tower triangulation.</li></ol><p>The third point is only present because of a worrying amount of mishaps that have been caught. I don&#39;t consider myself to be qualified to review the airplane mode source code. Even if I did, I&#39;d suspect a hardware backdoor, that cannot be circumvented even with a kill-switch. I do not believe that you are in any way more qualified to judge these things even if you had access to the OS source code. There are far too many omissions in the rest of your article, Madaidan, for you to plausibly be able to identify flaws in Apple devices.</p><blockquote><p>The network kill switch is useless for preventing data exfiltration since the attacker can just wait until you toggle the switch on again to exfiltrate data. If you need to temporarily disable network access, you can use airplane mode. Airplane mode can be disabled via a software vulnerability, but if an attacker has those capabilities already, then they can also simply sit and record any sensitive data and eventually upload it once you re-enable the hardware network kill switch, making it no more effective than airplane mode.</p></blockquote><p>This is the part, where I&#39;m sure most serious people in the audience are performing their favourite facepalm manoeuvres. A statement this dumb, on a blog post by a security researcher should immediately get you fired.</p><p>The biggest problem with &quot;Airplane mode&quot; as I said previously is</p><ol><li><p>I don&#39;t know precisely what it does, and it highly depends on the device. I get that the author of the article may have been one wee few that was given a glimpse of what they think is the source code for the aforementioned &quot;more secure&quot; proprietary operating systems. The author would do well to read &quot;<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reflections on Trusting Trust</a>&quot;, and draw their own conclusions, about how incredibly stupid it is to rely on a software kill switch, if the likely area that can be compromised is also software, but not hardware. I can&#39;t spoof a hardware switch without a few weeks with the device, and a ton of microsoldering equipment. I can spoof an overlay that presents itself as the nebulous &quot;Airplane mode&quot; in a few hours. Less if I have access to a team of programmers.</p></li><li><p>it&#39;s a software lock. It can be disabled in a myriad ways, only one of which implies the kind of access that was mentioned. Most data exfiltrations are time sensitive, often getting information on a rendezvous location is useless after the rendezvous took place. The author, of course, also ignores that the owner of a Linux phone probably has a few more tricks up their sleeve if they suspect data exfiltration: for example, a full reboot into a core set of trusted applications, possibly on a different partition on the same physical device. The fun fact about that, is that the core set might also include a change in security policies and a completely different set of tools: a different package manager, init system and a completely orthogonal threat vector.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>The camera kill switch can be useful as a small usability improvement, but it is really no better than some tape.</p></blockquote><p>I&#39;m guessing that the author never had to clean off tape residue off of the camera.</p><blockquote><p>Hardware kill switches are nothing but marketing frills.</p></blockquote><p>I agree, but not for any reason presented in the text. Hardware is complex. Some pieces of hardware can be self-contained and self-powered, not to mention that without a concrete trace layout, even ignoring the fact that your camera might still spy on you in the &quot;off&quot; state, I can&#39;t even tell if the switch is doing anything at the hardware level, or just telling the firmware to pretend that it can&#39;t access the hardware.</p><p>The reason why I bring this up, despite agreeing with the general sentiment is this: to kill an argument, you only must defend it badly.</p><h2 id="pureos-is-not-particularly-secure" tabindex="-1">PureOS is not particularly secure <a class="header-anchor" href="#pureos-is-not-particularly-secure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;PureOS is not particularly secure&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the sense in which it is not significantly more secure than e.g. Debian, I agree. In the sense that Debian isn&#39;t the most secure base I also agree. I&#39;m even willing to concede, that in some ways Apple devices are more secure too. But the assertion that it is in any way inferior to Windows or Android to me seems laughable.</p><blockquote><p>PureOS does not apply the exec-shield patch</p></blockquote><p>Not applicable to non-x86 architectures.</p><blockquote><p>so that sysctl doesn&#39;t even exist in the first place.</p></blockquote><p>So many mistakes in this one phrase. First of all <code>sysctl</code> does exist on PureOS, secondly, the existence and non-existence of <code>sysctl</code> has nothing to do with the exec-shield patch, and thirdly, the presence of <code>sysctl</code> isn&#39;t necessarily a good thing in terms of security.</p><blockquote><p>The purpose of disabling kexec is to prevent root from booting a malicious kernel,</p></blockquote><p>No. The purpose of disabling <code>kexec</code> is to prevent <code>root</code> from loading a malicious kernel on top of the currently running one.</p><blockquote><p>but root can do so many other things to modify the kernel, such as loading a kernel module.</p></blockquote><p>Or changing the default kernel in the bootloader. These are true statements that have no bearing on the argument made: if an attacker gains root access on Windows, Mac OS, Android and IOS you&#39;re fucked. Disabling <code>kexec</code> is not going to change that, but it will reduce the potential for non-root users to use an SUID application to gain root access and install a malicious kernel withtout rebooting. Here the presence of a security measure like Verified boot would have been useful, in the sense that the attacker might need to do more work to get a malicious kernel running on your device, but not significant.</p><blockquote><p>Attempting to hide kernel symbols via kptr_restrict ignores the fact that they&#39;re clearly visible in the System.map file on disk, among other sources.</p></blockquote><p>This is probably the only argument that makes sense… on some level… You see, kernel symbols genuinely are more vulnerable on Linux than on Mac OS or Windows. The <code>kptr_restrict</code> is used more as a protective measure against programmer error, rather than a security restriction to genuinely protect kernel symbols from outside attacks. I do, however, suspect that at some point this might change and the other sources of access to kernel functions is going to be reduced to none, given enough time.</p><p>Linus Torvalds is acutely aware of the kernel exploits, and if Linux were to become a wide-spread target, there is great incentive to fix these problems. More to the point, since Linux is free and Open Source, forking it, hardening, and patching it is never out of question.</p><blockquote><p>And finally, disabling source routing is already a Debian default.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah. So somehow using sane defaults is a sign of being &quot;not particularly secure&quot;. The problem here, of course isn&#39;t just of double standards, but of semantics of conversational english. If an english-speaking, particularly british person tells you that &quot;X is not particularly Y&quot;, where Y is some positive metric, the implication is that X is below average in terms of Y. By operating system standards PureOS is comparable to Mac OS in terms of security. It loses in usability and stability, of course, but being tied with the top non-Linux contender is hardly below average. And Linux can offer much more secure systems by design. Tails and Qubes could work wonders on Pinephone. If only Madaidan worked on that instead of propagating his contrarian opinion.</p><p>This latter point is especially interesting, because Madaidan is allegedly involved in the development of Whonix.</p><p>I do not think that Madaidan is stupid enough to use dubious arguments to support strong claims. Of the many operating systems that he&#39;s comparing, only Linux on desktop and Linux on phones have all the variables known. You can only certainly claim that Linux does X thing the Y way, which opens them up to the Z attack vector, anyone can in principle look at the source code and barring compiler issues, convince themselves of the validity of that claim. We cannot however do the same with Mac OS. For all we know, any of the features claiming to protect our privacy might be security theatre.</p><p>Another point against Madaidan&#39;s arguments is that when taken in a vacuum they are inconsistent, and given the context, incredibly short-sighted. On the one hand, he has a habit of citing some statistics out of thin air. W feature mitigates the Z attack vector on Linux, but it&#39;s rarely used. In a vacuum, this is a non-argument, the attack vector is either mitigated or not. If it&#39;s mitigated even on one Linux distribution, then your previous claim is false. When we add context things become even worse. Suppose Windows <em>does</em> mitigate the vector Z. Suppose that we also concede that the dubious statistics are accurate and the mitigation is made irrelevant by its infrequent and inappropriate use by the majority of the distribution vendors. Well… in reality the mitigation for Z is present on the latest version of windows. More people run Windows XP than Linux, and I sincerely doubt that XP can have the requisite mitigations even in principle. Not to mention that the average intelligence of an average Linux user compares to that of a Windows user the same as the intelligence of a Physics masters&#39; student when compared to the cognitive abilities of a banana.</p><p>In security, a system is considered only as safe as the weakest link. No matter how hard you&#39;ll nitpick on Linux lacking X, you&#39;d still be stuck with moronic habits deliberately conditioned inside Microsoft&#39;s clients. Windows users are so habituated to relinquishing control over their system to third parties with at best dubious motivations, that even if the only way in which a Windows virus could infect a Windows machine were if the user clicked &quot;Yes I want my machine to be infected by malware. Yes, I&#39;m that stupid. And I also hereby consribe myself to slave labour for a term of 40 years starting now&quot;, you&#39;d still get a large proportion of infected machines. The impenetrable learned stupidity of Windows users is the real problem. It&#39;s the only security flaw.</p><p>Recently we had a long-time Windows user, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Sebastian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Linus Sebastian</a> wipe their X.Org on Pop!<em>OS</em>. This is 100% the habituation of idiocy imposed by Windows. He was so used to programs showing walls of text that has no consequence and no informational content, that when the program literally told him &quot;What you&#39;re about to do is incredibly dangerous and stupid. We need to know that you <em>know what you&#39;re doing</em>, so type in <strong>do as I say</strong>&quot;, he ignored the text and typed that in. Is Linus an idiot? No. Not inherently. Had he grown up on Linux, he wouldn&#39;t have made that mistake.</p><h3 id="linux-libre" tabindex="-1">Linux Libre <a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-libre" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Linux Libre&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>PureOS also uses linux-libre. This will prevent the user from loading any proprietary firmware updates which just so happens to be almost all of them. The Librem 5 prevents the user from updating new firmware even with an alternative kernel which forces the user to use outdated and insecure firmware with known vulnerabilities.</p></blockquote><p>I agree… Kinda. I can see how an Apple device could compare favourably here, since they control the full hardware stack, and firmware updates are not an issue. I don&#39;t see how an Android device that uses a solidified kernel and doesn&#39;t provide any updates to the userspace after a poultry two to three years of use can possibly compare favourably here. Android screwed the pooch, proverbially, and dropped the ball figuratively, even before hitting the ground.</p><p>You do however, see a fallacy here. The assumption is that only a proprietary firmware can be flahsed on a Librem phone, when in reality the whole point of a FOSS firmware is that it is Open Source, and thus can be modified patching any mitigations. Of course, this is the mindset needed to perpetuate the prevalence of proprietary software.</p><blockquote><p>Although one way to fix the issues in software would be to install a more sane OS like Android or its derivatives, such as GrapheneOS, if support for the hardware was added. Keep in mind though that it would still lack important hardware and firmware security features like verified boot so it still isn&#39;t close to a normal Android device.</p></blockquote><p>The way to fix these issues, dear Madaidan, is to ask you to shut up when the grown ups are talking. I could have perhaps phrased this a bit more diplomatically, after all, I want this to be a civilised discussion. Not necessarily should have however, since even Jean-Luc Picard didn&#39;t shy away from asking Wesley Crusher to &quot;shut up&quot;. And then we get to the fact that Wesley was a child prodigy saying mostly correct things in stark contrast to Madaidan, whose every coherent idea is supported by the weakest arguments, despite years of experience.</p><p>The author has demonstrated their incompetence in many ways throughout the article, and I don&#39;t believe that it is possible to further discredit oneself more than by picking the worst of two possible options.</p><p>Graphene OS, has none of the aforementioned weaknesses covered. Furthermore, since it relies on largely proprietary &quot;apps&quot;, it exposes itself to a far broader range of attacks.</p><h3 id="and-so-on-which-modern-android-phones-already-deploy" tabindex="-1">and so on which modern Android phones already deploy. <a class="header-anchor" href="#and-so-on-which-modern-android-phones-already-deploy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;and so on which modern Android phones already deploy.&quot;">​</a></h3><p>First, I&#39;d like to take this time to remind you of an old principle in logic and debating: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Define modern Android phone. Is it a Galaxy S22? Is it a Sony Xperia one two? Or is it my Samsung Galaxy S7 edge?</p><p>Considering that both the Pinephone and Librem are based off of SoC&#39;s that are comparable in both performance and age to my Galaxy S7, I&#39;d be happy to make a fair comparison.</p><p>First of all, my Galaxy S7 edge doesn&#39;t receive updates. I bought it four years ago, and call me old-fashioned, but I&#39;d consider the one poultry year of updates and two years of no updates whatsoever a huge security risk. one year later, the same will be true of the S10 and one more – S22.</p><p>The reason why this is important is the following. What house is more likely to get robbed? The house where the owner changes cheap locks periodically, or a house with an expensive lock that gets abandoned for years? The state of &quot;modern&quot; android phones is likely to be frozen for a while. At the same time, every single one of the arguments presented here, had they been merited, would have been patched in a growing ecosystem of devices. Linux phone owners are also the kinds of people who are likely to upgrade more than just the Operating system kernel when given the opportunity.</p><p>And this is kind of important. The only valid argument in the entire article had been that hardware kill switches are superfluous, every single argument was beside the point.</p><h2 id="examples" tabindex="-1">Examples <a class="header-anchor" href="#examples" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Examples&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Oh boy.

It&#39;s not essential, just an indication of how little effort was spent in considering the example, though we shall see that in more detail if it&#39;s not readily apparent.</p><p>It might come as a shock, but not all <code>sudo</code> configurations are alike, and mine shows asterisks whenever I type. Some systems don&#39;t come with <code>sudo</code> and most often, good programs don&#39;t rely on explicit privilege escalation, but rather rely on PolicyKit, which in my opinion is the superior solution, and we should abandon all others. Often, we have what&#39;s called a <code>sudo</code> loop, wherein two subsequent calls re-requesting the password would seem suspicious.</p><p>Another point of contention is the assumption that this is only specific to Linux. Spoofing administrative dialogues is very much possible on OS X too. In fact the very same script would work like magic on Mac OS.</p><p>But OK. Suppose we suspend the disbelief and assume that it <em>is</em> possible to spoof <code>sudo</code>. I mean that script works, but it wouldn&#39;t work on my system for the following reasons:</p><ol><li><p><code>sudo</code> is a fish shell alias to <code>pkexec</code>. Your script simply won&#39;t execute.</p></li><li><p>If you somehow bypassed the shell alias (and you have to target all shells, because Linux users tend to use esoteric stuff quite often), your prompt would be wrong. It would immediately give itself away, as a GUI prompt is starkly different to <code>sudo</code>.</p></li><li><p>Ignoring the two above facts, what if I don&#39;t run a prompt for certain actions. What if I specifically set <code>sudo</code> <em>not</em> to prompt for a password when using a package manager? I&#39;d be immediately suspicious.</p></li></ol><p>But of course, let&#39;s indulge in our suspension of disbelief a while longer. Suppose that none of the above were true, and we <em>were indeed</em> oblivious to a keylogging attack and you got a few useful exploits out of it. Suppose also that the attacker got a little more sophisticated too. What&#39;s the most reliable way to patch it out? Simple. Make <code>sudo</code> a shell builtin that cannot be overriden and resolves to the proper <code>sudo</code> installed in the system. We kinda did do that with <code>rm -rf /</code>, who says we can&#39;t do it now.</p><p>The real solution, of course, is to use <code>PolKit</code> and have it handle both privileged password entry, and whether or not it can be called non-interactively: I believe that even allowing a privilege escalation program to be passed a password explicitly, without verifying the input was is a mistake. <code>doas</code> doesn&#39;t have this problem either.</p><blockquote><p>Alternatively, an attacker could log keystrokes via X11:</p></blockquote><p>Guess what is being phased out in favour of Wayland? On Gnome, which is what 90% of Linux users run you&#39;d have to go out of your way to use X.Org in any capacity other than XWayland, which has the protection against keylogging.</p><p>No seriously, Wayland is going to be the standard on Desktop Linux, and it still isn&#39;t because of a lot of 3rd-party developer complacency and a bit of a small early-adopter chicken and egg problem.</p><p>With that said, if you have to use X11, I would advise attaching some form of notification to running <code>xinput</code> . If you are using <code>PolicyKit</code>, you don&#39;t need to do much, because the input is grabbed exclusively, and no other application can view that privileged information.</p><p>But that&#39;s not all. I once wrote a Mac OS X keylogger as part of a job interview. It took me a week at the most. And it didn&#39;t just log keystrokes, that&#39;s trivial, it logged the cursor entering various applications and it even extracted the URL of what you were looking at in Safari and Firefox. The keylogger itself can be cobbled together in a few hours, by the way, the real reason it took me a week, had to do with that I had to write a whole GUI Qt application, and it was my first bottom up build + deploy.</p><p>Finally, if we&#39;re really asking for my opinion, passwords are dumb and an inadequate security measure, which most phones don&#39;t even use. A Linux phone will probably follow Apple and Google&#39;s lead, and handle most if not all authentication either via a weak-ass passcode, or biometrics, which can still be spoofed, but not without physical access. In my not-so-humble opinion, you need a hadrware solution, like YubiKey, combined with a biometric solution.</p><blockquote><p>Those listed above are merely a few examples and do not even require exploiting bugs.</p></blockquote><p>They are indeed examples; they require a suspension of disbelief. It&#39;s not unlikely that a Linux user would have uncostomised bash, and my use case is probably niche. However, it is fallacy to assume that someone who uses an uncostomised command line would prefer to use <code>sudo</code> in general. You can easily have a rolling-release Arch install and never touch the command line: I do it right now, in fact. Garuda and Manjaro and heavily customised Arch have a full set of tools that make using CLI programs redundant. Good luck spoofing an <code>fprintd</code> equipped Polkit authentication dialogue, and the entirety of Gnome Software. It&#39;s doable, but more effort than on Mac OS and windows, because instead of a single and standard point of entry, you have multiple non-overlapping ones.</p><p>This is an assumption that would hold true in some cases, however, so we should propose a solution to those as well. One particular solution is to periodically check your <code>.bashrc</code> and environment variables. Most applications warn you if you run them with <code>LD_PRELOAD</code>, which must be explicitly disabled on a per-application basis.</p><p>Weirdly, this article is a good illustration for why Linux phones would be far more secure than e.g. IOS or Android devices: if some half-baked security researcher finds a way to break something and find an exploit, it will get patched either by the creator of the software, or by some enterprising avid reader of &lt;insert pretentious security blog name here&gt;. Meanwhile, Apple, Google and Microsoft are content sitting on bugs for decades, because they can simply buy out the bug bounties.</p><p>With that said, Linux is far from being 100% secure. No system can be. But it takes more than a self-identified security expert and buzzwords like MAC policies, verified boot and <code>&lt;trendy buzzword #3&gt;</code>. The writer clearly has an extremely superficial acquaintance with real security work, all they did was collage information already available to them. They have an extremely superficial acquaintance with Linux as well. They seem to know that bubblewrap is less common than firejail, but don&#39;t seem to know that almost all of what they described applies to Mac OS, IOS, Windows and Android to the same if not greater extent. The lack of self-discipline in terms of value judgements leaves any unbiased reviewer biased against the author, which is unfortunate.</p><p>We need articles <em>like this one</em>, in the sense that we need to look critically at what can be done to improve the security of the most widely used server OS. What we do not need, however, is low quality shill pieces. I really wish I could say otherwise, but Madaidan&#39;s unrestrained value judgements and statements of fact, which turn out to be based on fairly weak assumptions and malicious leaps of logic that give a free pass to anyone uncritically accepting even somewhat plausible explanations for extremely unlikely statements.</p><h2 id="the-great-contrarian" tabindex="-1">The &quot;great&quot; contrarian <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-great-contrarian" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The &quot;great&quot; contrarian&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It should be noted that the general consensus on Linux is that it is inherently more secure than Windows. I firmly believe that Madaidan&#39;s blog post is partly motivated by the desire to appear contrarian, to show off these pesky stupid experts and thus elevate themself above and beyond the alredy well-regarded intelligent people. A similar occurrence in my field is the unexplainable disdain for String theory. Since string theory is hard, an expert in it is a step above a physicist doing climate, so naturally if you shit on string theorists, you feel like you&#39;re even cooler than they are.</p><p>The two articles: the piece on the security of Linux and Linux phones runs contrary to common sense, to the opinion of the vast majority of security experts and to the professional choices of MadAidan. There is a reason, why there are still a handful of known unique pieces of Linux malware, hundreds of known Mac OS trojans, and millions of incidences of Windows viruses. And no, it&#39;s not because Linux is a small community with a small install base, containing nothing more than their owner&#39;s hopes and dreams… Windows is a toy operating system, that while dominant in the PC space, is almost completely irrelevant in mobile devices, supercomputers, and servers. Mac OS, similarly, is rarely seen outside of the so-called Apple ecosystem. If fewer installs and no useful data should result in less malware, by all rights Linux should have been the number one target for the better part of this millenium. Linux is not more secure because of its predicament in the PC arena, but despite it.</p><p>Throughout this piece we have provided counter-arguments to each of the presented issues. However, we should note that the authors of this article do not think that Linux is the most secure that it can be, or that critical looks at Linux security can only stem from a contrarian-ness and paid promotion of competing standards. We actively encourage people who work on Linux, to provide valid critique provided that a few common courtesies are observed.</p><blockquote><p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p></blockquote><p>Sources are good. Every claim should be substantiated with data and/or logic. Some claims like &quot;and is rarely used&quot; are acceptable, being that it is your opinion that something should be used more frequently. If on the other hand it is used to say &quot;Something exists and invalidates my point, but fortunately it&#39;s rarely used&quot;, you should supplement this with a reliable source.</p><blockquote><p>Clichés are not inherently bad, they became clichés precisely because of being effective.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes the accepted opinion is also correct. If the consensus amongst a community is that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, anthropogenic climate change is measurable and civilisation-threatening, claiming otherwise is extremely damaging. Claiming otherwise, whilst also abusing your high social standing is doubly worse.</p><blockquote><p>Even the sun has spots. To err is to be human.</p></blockquote><p>It&#39;s Ok to be wrong. It&#39;s Ok to be wrong about somethng that you specialise in. The only person that gets fucked over when you leave no room for concessions is you, when you are inevitably found guilty of being incorrect.</p><blockquote><p>Even the broken clock is sometimes right.</p></blockquote><p>And sometimes you will occasionally be right. It won&#39;t save you. We have to agree with you all along the way, and not in a few very specific narrow cases.</p><blockquote><p>A cornered animal is the most fierce.</p></blockquote><p>If you leave the defendant in a position in which they have to concede gross incompetence they will never be converted. Sometimes that&#39;s precisely what you want, but often, if you want someone to change their opinion, it&#39;s better to give them the benefit of the doubt, and provide an escape hatch.</p><blockquote><p>The best way to defeat an argument is to defend it badly</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Neitzsche</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Often, the smartest thing you can do is shut up. The second smartest thing to do (given that you&#39;ve already dispelled the illusions of intelligence), is to concede wrongdoing. But the single dumbest thing to do is to misrepresent a valid point of view. Linux is not 100% secure. The worst thing you can do to ruin this point&#39;s credibility is to compare it to other operating systems that cannot match it.</p><blockquote><p>Truth is the ultimate goal of the argument</p></blockquote><p>Your motivation should be to uncover the truth and dispel misconceptions. If all you do is advertise and idea, you are no longer a living human being with thoughts and meditations, you&#39;re a product, and your thoughts are content. Be mindful of that.</p><blockquote><p>and so on</p></blockquote><p><strong>AND SO WHAT?!</strong> If you had provided verifiable irrefutable arguments to prove your contrarian point, the &quot;and so on&quot; would insenuate, that you have more in store that you just didn&#39;t bother with, because it was lower quality and/or very technical. Had any of your points A) been correct, B) been supported by the strongest arguments that are accessible to you, and C) been verifiable; this proverbial mike drop would have served you well. The problem is that most of your arguments are A) incorrect, B) supported by implausible bullshit that seems far fetched even if we give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you have information we don&#39;t, and C) is completely irrefutable in the Popperian sense, because it assumes access to information that is not commonly available, the entire &quot;and so on&quot; translates to, &quot;there&#39;s stuff that&#39;s somehow even less convincing than my post&quot;. I&#39;m intrigued.</p><p>I mean really, are we meant to tremble in fear and choose to go back to Windows or Mac OS? What is the intention behind all of this? You&#39;re not fooling anyone with a functioning brain and access to Google, Bing or DuckDuckGo. Is this meant for business executives?</p></div></div></main><footer class="VPDocFooter" data-v-44b2ba75 data-v-f79d867c><!--[--><!--]--><!----><nav class="prev-next" data-v-f79d867c><div class="pager" data-v-f79d867c><!----></div><div class="pager" data-v-f79d867c><a class="VPLink link pager-link next" href="/docs/llms-replace-humans.html" data-v-f79d867c><!--[--><span class="desc" data-v-f79d867c>Next page</span><span class="title" data-v-f79d867c>LLMs won't replace you</span><!--]--></a></div></nav></footer><!--[--><!--]--></div></div></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><!----><!--[--><!--]--></div></div>
